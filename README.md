# machine_learing_project

This is the machine-learing project for classification tasks in face-recognition competition on kaggle. The dataset can be downloaded from the kaggle link https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge .

There are three folders. 
Code in dataset_process folder is for processing the data. Divide_dataset.py is for dividing the original dataset into training set, validation set and testing set. convert_csv2gray.py is for converting the vetors in fer2013.csv to gray images, for better visualization. Such visualization well be also used in the adversarial attack part. 

Code in models folder is the deep neural networks we have used. 

Code in adversarial_attack is for adversarial attack.
